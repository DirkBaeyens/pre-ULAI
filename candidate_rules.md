# Candidate Rules for Kernel Expansion

These rules are not yet in the universal kernel. They are staged for testing, refinement, or integration later.

1. **Waveform Exchange**  
   "A waveform can be seen as the workform of balance between opposing forces, exchanging energy as it moves."

2. **Opposite Grounding**  
   "Imbalances seek grounding or an outlet; the path of least resistance resolves tension."

3. **Opposite Intensity**  
   "The stronger and closer the opposites, the stronger the exchange or reaction."

4. **Group Amplification**  
   "Grouped forces or imbalances combine to amplify reactions."
