# SESSION_SUMMARY.md
## Project: Pre-Universal Logic AI (pre-ULAI)
**Date/Time:** 2025-08-15 16:45 (update format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

---

## Project Overview
pre-ULAI aims to explore a new AI architecture based on universal logic principles derived from:
- Energetic and matter cycles (micro to macro)
- Continuous inflow/outflow and overloading/dispersing cycles
- Multi-dimensional, interconnected systems
- Foundational logic independent of monetary, paper, or institutional limitations

The AI will have:
- A **core logic base** (`logic_base.py`) with fundamental rules
- Modular structure allowing updates and extensions
- Tracking of versions and timestamps in code files
- A changelog for continuous monitoring

---

## Repository Structure


---

## Current Implementation
### Core Logic
- **logic_base.py**: foundational rules and functions
- Uses universal energy/matter cycles as conceptual rules
- Each update tagged with full timestamp: `# Version: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`

### Other Modules
- Module files created for future AI behaviors
- Integration planned between modules and core logic

### Version Control
- Git is used locally and on GitHub
- Upload strategy: manual series updates
- Recommendation: track each series update in CHANGELOG.md and SESSION_SUMMARY.md
- Future versions may include timestamp at hours and minutes

---

## Key Notes from Current Session
1. Local updates do not require immediate Git commit, but structured commits are safer.
2. Manual upload per series is used due to push/authentication issues.
3. Python 3 is required for local testing (`python3 core/logic_base.py`).
4. Each file update carries a version timestamp for traceability.
5. The project is a mix of text-based reasoning, code, and logic modeling.
6. Continuity strategy: SESSION_SUMMARY.md will serve as the main continuity log for future chat switches or AI model changes.

---

## Next Steps / To-Do
- Continue building core logic with universal rules
- Expand modules for behavior simulation
- Maintain SESSION_SUMMARY.md and CHANGELOG.md for each update
- Implement logic tests to validate reasoning consistency
- Consider adding a “universal rules database” for rules extracted from past chat sessions

## References / Inspirations
- Chat-based discussions of universal energy/matter cycles
- Conceptual model: inflow (matter), outflow (energy), spinning seeds as micro-blackholes
- Multi-scale approach from atoms → solar systems → cosmic structures
- Emphasis on open, transparent reasoning, independent of institutional science
