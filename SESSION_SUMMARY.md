## Project: Pre-Universal Logic AI (pre-ULAI)
**Date/Time:** 2025-08-15 16:45 (update format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

## Project Overview
pre-ULAI aims to explore a new AI architecture based on universal logic principles derived from:
- Energetic and matter cycles (micro to macro)
- Continuous inflow/outflow and overloading/dispersing cycles
- Multi-dimensional, interconnected systems
- Foundational logic independent of monetary, paper, or institutional limitations

The AI will have:
- A **core logic base** (`logic_base.py`) with fundamental rules
- Modular structure allowing updates and extensions
- Tracking of versions and timestamps in code files
- A changelog for continuous monitoring
