# SESSION SUMMARY – pre-ULAI Project
# Version: 2025-08-19 20:45

## 1. Project Status
- Current phase: Reasoning Engine prototype + test observations working.
- Goal: Build foundation for universal logic AI (pre-ULAI).

## 2. Files Overview
- `main.py` → entry point, calls ReasoningEngine.
- `core/logic_base.py` → basic logic structure.
- `core/reasoning_engine.py` → loads rules, applies reasoning.
- `core/universal_rules.py` → universal rules (list of dicts).
- `test_observations.py` → runs test inputs through ReasoningEngine.
- `CHANGELOG.md` → manual version tracking.
- `README.md` → project overview.
- `sessions/SESSION_SUMMARY.md` → session handover notes.
- `sessions/001.md`, `sessions/002.md`, … → archived session logs.

Universal Basic Logic Rules
---------------------------
This file defines the most fundamental temporary logic rules for the pre-ULAI project.
These are not scientific laws but simple universal reasoning seeds.
