# pre-ULAI

**Pre-Unified Logic AI (pre-ULAI)** is an experimental project exploring how basic universal reasoning seeds can be encoded, tested, and gradually expanded into more complex logic structures.
This project is **not scientific law**, but rather a sandbox for reasoning, testing, and observing patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* **main.py** â†’ Entry point of the project
* **core/** â†’ Contains the main logic

  * `logic_base.py` â†’ Foundations of the system
  * `reasoning_engine.py` â†’ Engine for applying rules to observations
  * `universal_rules.py` â†’ Set of universal basic rules
* **tests/** â†’ Contains test scripts, e.g. `test_observations.py`
* **sessions/** â†’ Session summaries for continuity between chats
* **CHANGELOG.md** â†’ Tracks code and file updates
* **README\_CONTINUE.md** â†’ Instructions for continuing the project in a new chat session

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the main entry point:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Run the observation test:

```bash
python3 test_observations.py
```

## ðŸ§ª Current Capabilities

* Defines **universal rules** such as causality, balance, continuity, interconnection, and cycles
* Allows adding **observations** and matching them against universal rules
* Outputs **reasoning categories** based on provided input

## ðŸ”„ Continuation of the Project

If this project is being continued in a **new chat session**, please read
[README\_CONTINUE.md](README_CONTINUE.md) for instructions.

That file explains how to use the latest `sessions/session_summary.md` to hand over the context into a new chat without losing progress.
