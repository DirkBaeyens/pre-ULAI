Got it 👍 — I’ll give you the **full rewritten `README.md`** as a single Markdown file without mixing code block formatting outside where it’s really needed. That way you can just copy-paste and save directly as `README.md`.

Here’s the clean version:

---

# pre-ULAI

**Pre-Unified Logic AI (pre-ULAI)** is an experimental project exploring how basic universal reasoning seeds can be encoded, tested, and gradually expanded into more complex logic structures.
This project is **not scientific law**, but rather a sandbox for reasoning, testing, and observing patterns.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

* **main.py** → Entry point of the project
* **core/** → Contains the main logic

  * `logic_base.py` → Foundations of the system
  * `reasoning_engine.py` → Engine for applying rules to observations
  * `universal_rules.py` → Set of universal basic rules
* **tests/** → Contains test scripts, e.g. `test_observations.py`
* **sessions/** → Session summaries for continuity between chats
* **CHANGELOG.md** → Tracks code and file updates
* **README\_CONTINUE.md** → Instructions for continuing the project in a new chat session

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the main entry point:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Run the observation test:

```bash
python3 test_observations.py
```

---

## 🧪 Current Capabilities

* Defines **universal rules** such as causality, balance, continuity, interconnection, and cycles
* Allows adding **observations** and matching them against universal rules
* Outputs **reasoning categories** based on provided input

---

## 🔄 Continuation of the Project

If this project is being continued in a **new chat session**, please read
[README\_CONTINUE.md](README_CONTINUE.md) for instructions.

That file explains how to use the latest `sessions/session_summary.md` to hand over the context into a new chat without losing progress.

---

## 📜 License

This project is currently **exploratory** and has no formal license.
Use, share, and adapt freely with attribution.

---

✅ This one you can drop in directly as `README.md` with no formatting issues.

Do you want me to also draft the first **README\_CONTINUE.md** right away so the link doesn’t point to an empty file?
