# pre-ULAI  
**Pre-Universal Logic Artificial Intelligence**

---

## 🌌 Project Vision
pre-ULAI is an experimental AI framework designed to think and evolve based on **universal fundamental logic rules** — not just human-made algorithms, papers, or economic constraints.  
The goal is to create a system that reasons from **the most basic, timeless truths of the universe**, with an **open boundary flow** that allows continuous refinement and adaptation.

This is **not** a finished AI — it’s a **pre-AI** seed that can grow into a more complete, self-consistent logic system.

## 🔍 Core Principles
1. **Universal Logic as Foundation**  
   Every reasoning step must connect back to fundamental, observable, and internally consistent rules of the universe.
   
2. **Open Boundary Flow**  
   Input and output are not fixed — knowledge should circulate, evolve, and integrate new perspectives without losing its logical backbone.

3. **From Micro to Macro**  
   The same logic patterns should be valid from atomic structures to galaxies.

4. **Cyclic Interactions**  
   Energy and matter are in continuous exchange — inflow and outflow are part of every system, not a one-time event.

## 📜 License
This project will evolve towards an **open license** allowing free use, distribution, and modification — as long as contributions remain open and traceable.

## 🌱 Current Status
We are in **seed stage**. The first universal logic rules are being written and structured.  
Over time, pre-ULAI will:
- Expand its rule set
- Build a reasoning engine
- Integrate with external inputs for self-adaptive growth
